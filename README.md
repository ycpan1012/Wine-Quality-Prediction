# Wine Quality Prediction

In this project, we analyzed data of red and white variants from Portuguese Vinho Verde wine to identify chemical properties that would influence the quality of wines by using machine learning algorithm in R programming. For our entire analysis, we will first look into the red wine dataset, conduct the same method in white wine data, and compare the results in two different wines.
